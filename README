ACL-Lean: Access Control Logic Theorem Prover

To launch ACL-Lean:
  1. Run SWI-Prolog ($ swipl);
  2. Load the latexify package (?- [latexify].).

Now you can prove formulas by typing:
  ?- prove(a->a).

Or you can run single test files as follows:
  ?- ['examples/Ex1.pl'].
or you can run all of the tests at once issuing:
  ?- ['examples/tests.pl'].
